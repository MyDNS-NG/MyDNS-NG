MyDNS - SQL-based DNS server

This is the MyDNS package.  MyDNS is a simple, non-recursive Internet
name daemon which serves records directly from an SQL database.  It
currently works with either MySQL or PostgreSQL.

This version of the MyDNS package is a development of the original one
produced by Don Moore.

This original package has a homepage on the WWW at the following URL:

Code contributions and input are appreciated.  See the TODO file for a
list of things that need to be done.

MyDNS allows internationalization via GNU gettext.  Translations
are encouraged and gladly accepted.

If you are looking for the web interface for MyDNS, it's included in
the MyDNS distribution as contrib/admin.php.  See contrib/README for
installation instructions.
